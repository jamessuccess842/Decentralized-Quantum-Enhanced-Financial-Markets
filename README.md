# Decentralized Quantum-Enhanced Financial Markets

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing quantum-enhanced financial trading markets using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized financial market infrastructure that leverages quantum computing principles for enhanced trading, risk assessment, and market stability. The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a robust, compliant, and stable quantum financial ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### 1. Market Verification Contract (`market-verification.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Validates and registers quantum-enhanced trading systems
- **Key Features**:
    - System registration with quantum scoring
    - Performance metrics tracking
    - Verification status management
    - Minimum requirements enforcement (quantum score ≥ 50, accuracy ≥ 80%)

#### 2. Quantum Algorithm Contract (`quantum-algorithm.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Manages deployment and performance of quantum trading algorithms
- **Key Features**:
    - Algorithm deployment and lifecycle management
    - Performance tracking and efficiency calculation
    - Quantum complexity scoring
    - Success rate monitoring

#### 3. Risk Assessment Contract (`risk-assessment.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Performs quantum-enhanced risk analysis for trading systems
- **Key Features**:
    - Multi-factor risk assessment (volatility, correlation)
    - Risk level classification (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
    - Historical risk tracking
    - Trend analysis

#### 4. Market Stability Contract (`market-stability.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Maintains overall market stability through quantum metrics
- **Key Features**:
    - Real-time stability monitoring
    - Automated intervention triggers
    - Quantum coherence tracking
    - Global stability scoring

#### 5. Regulatory Compliance Contract (`regulatory-compliance.clar`)
- **Purpose**: Ensures adherence to quantum market regulations
- **Key Features**:
    - Entity registration and compliance tracking
    - Rule management and violation reporting
    - Automated penalty calculation
    - Audit trail maintenance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js (for testing)
- Vitest testing framework

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quantum-financial-markets
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Contract Deployment

Deploy contracts in the following order to ensure proper dependencies:

1. `regulatory-compliance.clar`
2. `market-verification.clar`
3. `quantum-algorithm.clar`
4. `risk-assessment.clar`
5. `market-stability.clar`

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Trading System

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .market-verification register-trading-system u85 u90 u95 u80)
;; Returns: (ok u1) - system ID
\`\`\`

### Deploying a Quantum Algorithm

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .quantum-algorithm deploy-algorithm "QuantumTrader" u50 u85)
;; Returns: (ok u1) - algorithm ID
\`\`\`

### Performing Risk Assessment

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .risk-assessment perform-risk-assessment u1 u30 u40)
;; Returns: (ok u1) - assessment ID
\`\`\`

### Registering for Compliance

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .regulatory-compliance register-entity "TRADING_FIRM")
;; Returns: (ok u1) - entity ID
\`\`\`

## Key Concepts

### Quantum Scoring
- **Quantum Score**: Measures the quantum enhancement level of trading systems
- **Complexity Rating**: Evaluates algorithm sophistication
- **Coherence Level**: Tracks quantum state stability

### Risk Levels
- **Low (1)**: Combined risk score ≤ 50
- **Medium (2)**: Combined risk score 51-100
- **High (3)**: Combined risk score 101-150
- **Critical (4)**: Combined risk score > 150

### Stability Thresholds
- **Stability Score**: ≥ 80 for stable classification
- **Volatility Limit**: ≤ 30 for acceptable volatility
- **Quantum Coherence**: ≥ 70 minimum requirement

### Compliance Levels
- **Full Compliance**: 100 points
- **Partial Compliance**: 75 points (minimum for compliant status)
- **Minimal Compliance**: 50 points
- **Non-Compliant**: 0 points

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites for all contracts:

- `tests/market-verification.test.js`
- `tests/quantum-algorithm.test.js`
- `tests/risk-assessment.test.js`
- `tests/market-stability.test.js`
- `tests/regulatory-compliance.test.js`

Run all tests:
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Run specific test file:
\`\`\`bash
npx vitest tests/market-verification.test.js
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Contract owner privileges for critical functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **State Management**: Proper state transitions and consistency
- **Error Handling**: Descriptive error codes and messages
